Program to calculate future value of a savings account
==========================================================================
BEGIN
	//Algorithm: Future Value (FV) = P * (1 + r/n)^n*t
	//
	// WHERE:
	//
	// P = Principle (initial amount deposited)
	// r = Annual Interest Rate (between 0 and 1)
	// n = Number of compounding periods per year
	// t = time (in years) until money withdrawn
	//
	// Program Purpose : To find the future value in a savings account
	// based on the above information
	
	Output "This program will compute Future Value of an amoun invested in a checking account "
	Output "for a given number of years at a given fixed interest rate and a given number of "
	Output "compounding periods per year"

	// Get Principle
	Output "Please enter the initial amount invested in dollars           : "
	Input P

	// Get Annual Inerest Rate
	Output "Please enter the annual intereset rate in percentage (0-100)  : "
	Input r

	//Convert percent interest to number between 0 and 1
	r = r /100

	// Get Number of compounding periods per year
	Output "Please enter the Number of compounding periods per year       : "
	Input n

	// Get Number of years before money is withdrawn
	Output "Please enter the Number of years before money is withdrawn    : "
	Input t

	//Compute Future Value based on equation stated above in Algorithm
	FV = P * (1 + r/n)^n*t

	// Display Future Value to user
	Output "Future Value is												  : ", FV


	Output "Thank you for using he program"
